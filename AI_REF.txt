Easy modding for the game "7 Days to Die" largely consists of xpath operations to patch over values, or append / remove nodes in the game data.

The base game data itself can be found in Data\Config.

Examples of xpath operations can be found in the files under MOD_REFS.

Many of the xpath operations under MOD_REFS are no longer valid because the game has been updated in ways that change or remove reference names.
However, syntactically, all xpath operations found within are correct.

The assistant should reference both Data\Config and MOD_REFS when generating patch operation xml.
